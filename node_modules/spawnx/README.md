Remover
======

Flexible spawn() with exec() syntax.

Install
-------

    npm install spawnx

API
---

    spawnx(command, [options,] callback);


Usage
-----

``` js
var run = require('spawnx');

run('/path/to/command --foo bar 1', function(err, stdout, stderr) {
  console.log(err || stdout);
})

// let's pipe the output from the command to a log file as it comes.
var stream = fs.createWriteStream('output.log');

run('another_command --test', { cwd: '/tmp', stdout: stream }, function(err) {
  console.log('Finished');
  stream.close();
})
```

Options
-------

Whatever options you pass in the options argument will be passed to the actual
`spawn()` call. There are two additional options that you may pass: `stdout` and
`stderr`. If present, spawnx will pipe the output from the `spawn` command to
those streams. That way you can have live output of a running command.

Also important: the path to command may be relative, in which case the full
path is looked for by searching the environment's `$PATH`. If now `options.cwd` is
set, the command's dirname is set as the `cwd` for the spawn call.
